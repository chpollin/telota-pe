                           conspicuously <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">von Humboldt</a>’s Travels to

                           combined investigations during their perilous journey, have been called by a
                           competent judge a work <q>“of gigantic extent and richness to which the modern

                        <p class="text-paragraph">More than thirty years have elapsed since <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Humboldt</a> returned to Europe and his expressed wish, that he soon might
                           find a successor in a similar undertaking, may have been partly realized, but still
                           not to the full extent as the philosopher wished. Several journeys have been
                           undertaken to <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Colombia</a> and <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Brazil</a>, but neither has had a pure scientific
                           view for its object, and though Geography and Statistics in general may have reaped
                           some additions by these casual journeys, <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Humboldt</a>’s expressed hopes remain unrealized—no geographical
                           situations have been determined, no botanist has herbalized on the banks of the

                           reached by his journey and his subsequent publications, which resulted from the same,
                           might perhaps prevent the planning of a similar expedition, where the predecessor
                           was
                           so richly endowed with a genius, which in his sphere stands single at the present
                           age, but circumstances are the rulers of human undertakings and though <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Humboldt</a> determined the nature of the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Orinoco</a>’s communication with the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Rio Negro</a>, the more interesting object of their
                           journey, the mighty river’s sources, remained a geographical problem. The hostile
                           Indians prevented the travellers from penetrating much further than <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Esmeralda</a>. The circumstances may have
                           changed, and what <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Humboldt</a> found at that
                           time impossible, may be accomplished by perseverance. But this is not the only
                           stirring impulse to action, the illustrious traveller expresses frequently the wish,
                           that several geographical positions which unfavourable weather prevented him to
                           ascertain, might be hereafter astronomically determined. He entertained likewise the
                           hope, that a botanist might herbalize on the banks of the rivers, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Meta</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Vichada</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Zama</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Branco</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Negro</a>, &amp;c., &amp;c., and says especially, that a traveller, who
                           was favoured with the hospitality of the missionaries could spend a year on the banks
                           of the rivers <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Atabapo</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Tuamini</a> and <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Negro</a>, and a second year on the mountains of <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Esmeralda</a> and the upper <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Orinoco</a> might easily triplicate the species
                           described by <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Aublet</a> and <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Richard</a>. He was further obliged to restrict his
                           investigations only to the skirts of the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Sierra Parime</a>, and the interesting part, encompassed by the branches
                           of this mountain-chain, remained unexplored. Thus a rich field has been left open
                           for
                           further investigation, the happy result of which may amply reward the dangers and
                           perils connected with a similar enterprise, and though but few in the lapse of
                           centuries could dare to enter the lists with a <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Humboldt</a> whose rare talent possessed a variety of knowledge to avail
                           himself of every advantage, where opportunity offered him to exercise the same, still
                           I do not shrink from planning a new expedition to <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">South America</a>. Blessed with a strong
                           constitution and acclimatized during a sojourn of four years in the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">West Indies</a>, the most time of which was
                           spent in botanical excursions and surveying expeditions, accustomed therefore to
                           bodily exercises and possessed of some knowledge of physics, I hope a European public
                           will not consider it presumptuous and chimerical at my having resolved to undertake
                           a
                           scientific journey to <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">South
                              America</a>, provided I am encouraged and assisted; and in this respect I
                           have placed my chief anchor of hope on England, which has always shown herself ready
                           to protect schemes of utility and to give her powerful assistance to the execution
                           of
                           plans, which have been connected with the advancement of science and the furtherance

                           to a landscape by their lofty forms and majestic appearance. The banks of the

                           boast of. The cultivated ground yields the sugar cane, the coffee-tree, the cocoa,
                           the latter of which grows wild in some parts, as well as cinnamon, vanilla, the
                           nutmeg, pepper, the camphor tree, the delicious <a href="#flora-d2e515" class="flora-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Flora">Ananas</a>,

                           made in the same, and European grain is likewise cultivated upon fields, which rise
                           from 5 to 9,000 feet above the level of the sea, which gives to <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">South America</a> the advantages of the

It is divided into the empire of <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Brazil</a>, the republics of <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Colombia</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Venezuela</a>, <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Peru</a>,

                           between 13 and 14 million, there would not be more than 2 persons on each square mile
                           of its superficial area. The inhabitants are composed of whites, Indians and negroes
                           and their mixed races. The whites are mostly creoles, the number of Europeans is but
                           small. The Indians or native tribes are in some parts still independent, and have
                           been in others subdued and mostly converted to the Catholic religion. The negroes
                           are

                           main object of my journey, and to propose a route which shall conduct me to the

                           prospects and to the beauties of a favoured climate, describe on the way the
                           prominent features, which according to those, who visited or described these regions
                           before, astonish the wanderer or attract his contemplative and reflecting mind to
                           the

                           <li>1. To examine the features of the country, its mountains, the bed and banks of
                              rivers, whether navigable, whether tributary streams or the confluence of several,
                              the river’s descent, the productions of the soil through which it drains, the
                              country’s climate, its animal and vegetable kingdom.</li>
                           
                           <li>2. The character of the inhabitants—whether civilization has been attempted or
                              is in progress and by what nation, or what prospects there are for attempting it;
                              furthermore to make most minute observations, whether trade might be carried on
                              with them, in what the barter probably would consist and in what way the same
                              might be carried on to the greatest advantage for Europeans.</li>
                           
                           <li>3. To determine geographically the country which I investigate, by ascertaining
                              astronomically the most prominent features and to collect such materials as will
                              assist in forming accurate delineations of the same and to neglect no opportunity
                              to note such phenomena as might contribute to a description of its physical
                              geography.</li>
                           
                           <li>4. To form not only collections of plants, but likewise of minerals, insects,

                           </ul>
                        
                        
                        <p class="text-paragraph">Conformable to an expressed wish of the Royal Geographical Society of London, I would
                           commence my researches in <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Demerara</a>,
                           and laying the investigation of the Imataka mountains (between the 7th and 8th degree
                           of northern latitude) for the present aside, I place the reader at once on the river
                           <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a>, which is nine miles
                           west from the Demerary River, and its mouth above twenty miles wide. At the mouth
                           of
                           the same are three islands, which are valuable for the high state of their
                           cultivation; the easternmost is Leguan, that in the centre Wakenaam and the next
                           Tiger Island, which form four entrances into the river. Southward of these are a
                           succession of other islands, which extend five and twenty to thirty miles beyond the
                           first. About fifteen miles from the mouth is Fort-Island, which was formerly
                           fortified, but is now in decay. The tides of the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a> are pretty regular and extend nearly a hundred miles up.
                           The confluence of the rivers Coyoni or Cuyuni and Mazarony, with the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a> takes place about forty miles above
                           the river’s mouth (Lat 6° 24’ north). The Rinocote and the Usupania mountains give
                           an
                           opening to the Mazarony by a break in the hills which form in the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a> the 39 falls which are accounted
                           from Arinda (a former military post Lat. 5°30’ N.) to the mouth of the Rupunuri. Long
                           before we approach the confluence of these three rivers—(where there was formerly
                           opposite the stream Tupuro a Dutch military post, Kyk-over-al) all traces of
                           cultivation have disappeared, and the eye observes only an impenetrable forest, which
                           stretches from both sides of the river deep in the interior. The next river of
                           consequence which flows into the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a>, is the Sibarona, the sources of which are found on the
                           northern side of the Pacarayna mountains, at the same time the Tavaricuri, a
                           tributary stream of the Rupunuri originates on the southern side of the same group
                           of
                           mountains—thus drains the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a>
                           both declivities.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class="text-paragraph">The Rupunuri falls at 4° 10' Lat. into the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a>; between one of its tributary streams, which I named
                           already, the Tavaricuri and the stream Pirara, a tributary of the Mahu, exists a land
                           carriage (<span class="term">Portage</span>)—a small tongue of land, which divides the basin of
                           two rivers and over which the boats are either carried upon the shoulders of the crew
                           or dragged upon rollers—I shall henceforth call them "Portage"—a second one is more
                           southerly between the Rupunuri and the Sarauri, which flows into the Tacutu. The
                           first European who crossed the latter portage was <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Nicolas Hortsmann</a>, a native from Hildesheim in Germany and who had
                           settled as surgeon in Guiana. Attracted by the reports of great riches which might
                           be
                           discovered in the interior, he manned in 1739 a canoe (<span class="term">coreal</span>) with
                           Indians and ascended the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Essequebo</a>
                           and followed its course by dragging the canoe along its rapids and causing it to be
                           carried across the narrow neck of land, until he reached the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Rio Branco</a>, which he descended to the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Rio Negro</a> and arrived in 1740 in Pará. Here he
                           met the French academician M. Condamine, to whom he communicated a map of his route
                           and a sketch of his journal. This was very likely the journal, which afterwards was
                           found amongst the papers of the celebrated Geographer <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">d’Anville</a> and which <a href="#person-" class="person-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Humboldt</a> found an opportunity to peruse.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class="text-paragraph">At a later period (1793) Don Fr. José Rodriguez Barate (then stationed as ensign in
                           Pará) crossed this portage twice on his way to Surinam, where he went on the object
                           of business for his government; and but lately there arrived (February 1811) several
                           Dutch colonists by the same isthmus at the Portuguese fort San Joaquin in order to
                           receive permission from its commander to descend the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Rio Branco</a>.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class="text-paragraph">Having crossed the more northern portage between the Tavaricuri and the cano Pirara,
                           we find ourselves at once upon the classical ground of El Dorado de la Parime and
                           in
                           the midst of the high mountains, which since the 16th century encircled the Laguna

                           to this period are but imperfectly known and which are inhabited by independent
                           tribes of Indians. In the journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London II Vol.
                           p. 227 is an able treatise on the Indians which inhabit Demerara, to which I shall

                           we have passed in our route, but as particular interest is attached to the spot which
                           we have reached and which obliges us to make a halt and to recall bygone days; I
                           shall repair this omission and give now a connected view of the most distinguished

                           8th parallel of N. Lat and between the 66th and 68th Meridian (counted west from
                           Greenwich). Its general direction is westward which course is likewise kept by its
                           lateral branches; from the mouth of the Apure to the delta of the <a href="#place-" class="place-name entity-link" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="">Orinoco</a>, the distance of the ridge from the
                           banks of the river is generally 10 to 14 miles; some detached groups approach however
                           its very banks and form the rapids of Tomo, the Boca del Infierno and the narrow
                           passage at St. Thomas, from which the town has been named Angostura.</p>
