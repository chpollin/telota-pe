                        <p>Amongst the expeditions, which since <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.columbus">Columbus</span>'s times have been undertaken to the new continent, shine
                           conspicuously <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">von Humboldt</span>’s Travels to
                           the equinoctial regions, the happy result of which has so vastly enriched physical
                           science, that those publications which issued from <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> and <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.bonpland">Bonpland</span> (his
                           courageous and enlightened friend and fellow traveller) as the fruits of their
                           combined investigations during their perilous journey, have been called by a
                           competent judge a work <q>“of gigantic extent and richness to which the modern
                              literature of Europe can hardly offer a parallel.”</q> It does not belong to my
                           present subject to enumerate the addition which sciences in general received from
                           this expedition, their value has been acknowledged long before this by a grateful
                           public and placed the name of <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span>
                           amongst those, which even time will not obliterate.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>More than thirty years have elapsed since <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> returned to Europe and his expressed wish, that he soon might
                           find a successor in a similar undertaking, may have been partly realized, but still
                           not to the full extent as the philosopher wished. Several journeys have been
                           undertaken to <span class="place-name" data-id="place.colombia">Colombia</span> and <span class="place-name" data-id="place.brazil">Brazil</span>, but neither has had a pure scientific
                           view for its object, and though Geography and Statistics in general may have reaped
                           some additions by these casual journeys, <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span>’s expressed hopes remain unrealized—no geographical
                           situations have been determined, no botanist has herbalized on the banks of the

                        <p>The height of fame which <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> has
                           reached by his journey and his subsequent publications, which resulted from the same,
                           might perhaps prevent the planning of a similar expedition, where the predecessor
                           was
                           so richly endowed with a genius, which in his sphere stands single at the present
                           age, but circumstances are the rulers of human undertakings and though <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> determined the nature of the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span>’s communication with the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.negro">Rio Negro</span>, the more interesting object of their
                           journey, the mighty river’s sources, remained a geographical problem. The hostile
                           Indians prevented the travellers from penetrating much further than <span class="place-name" data-id="place.esmeralda">Esmeralda</span>. The circumstances may have
                           changed, and what <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> found at that
                           time impossible, may be accomplished by perseverance. But this is not the only
                           stirring impulse to action, the illustrious traveller expresses frequently the wish,
                           that several geographical positions which unfavourable weather prevented him to
                           ascertain, might be hereafter astronomically determined. He entertained likewise the
                           hope, that a botanist might herbalize on the banks of the rivers, <span class="place-name" data-id="river.meta">Meta</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="river.vichada">Vichada</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="river.zama">Zama</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="river.branco">Branco</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="river.negro">Negro</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c., and says especially, that a traveller, who
                           was favoured with the hospitality of the missionaries could spend a year on the banks
                           of the rivers <span class="place-name" data-id="river.atabapo">Atabapo</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="river.tuamini">Tuamini</span> and <span class="place-name" data-id="river.negro">Negro</span>, and a second year on the mountains of <span class="place-name" data-id="place.esmeralda">Esmeralda</span> and the upper <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span> might easily triplicate the species
                           described by <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.aublet">Aublet</span> and <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.richard">Richard</span>. He was further obliged to restrict his
                           investigations only to the skirts of the <span class="place-name" data-id="mountain.sierra_parime">Sierra Parime</span>, and the interesting part, encompassed by the branches
                           of this mountain-chain, remained unexplored. Thus a rich field has been left open
                           for
                           further investigation, the happy result of which may amply reward the dangers and
                           perils connected with a similar enterprise, and though but few in the lapse of
                           centuries could dare to enter the lists with a <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> whose rare talent possessed a variety of knowledge to avail
                           himself of every advantage, where opportunity offered him to exercise the same, still
                           I do not shrink from planning a new expedition to <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South America</span>. Blessed with a strong
                           constitution and acclimatized during a sojourn of four years in the <span class="place-name" data-id="place.west_indies">West Indies</span>, the most time of which was
                           spent in botanical excursions and surveying expeditions, accustomed therefore to
                           bodily exercises and possessed of some knowledge of physics, I hope a European public
                           will not consider it presumptuous and chimerical at my having resolved to undertake
                           a
                           scientific journey to <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South
                              America</span>, provided I am encouraged and assisted; and in this respect I
                           have placed my chief anchor of hope on England, which has always shown herself ready
                           to protect schemes of utility and to give her powerful assistance to the execution
                           of
                           plans, which have been connected with the advancement of science and the furtherance
                           of useful knowledge.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>In order to become more acquainted with the real object of my planned expedition,
                           I
                           attract the reader’s attention to the following observations which with the
                           assistance of the annexed Maps will partly point out my proposed route. The Map as
                           well as the observations have been mostly compiled from <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span>’s travels to the equinoctial Regions,
                           <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</span>’s Voyage to Demerary,
                           Colombia &amp; Vol. London. 1822, and for the further constructions of the map, I
                           have been assisted by "<span class="person-name" data-id="pers.tanner">Tanner</span>’s map of

                           S. and from 35° to 80° W. Longitude. It is connected with the northern part of the
                           new continent by the Isthmus of Darien and its greatest extent from the Gulf of
                           Maracaybo to the Straits of Magellan has been computed to consist of 4600 miles—its
                           greatest breadth from Cape St. Roque (Lat. 5° S.) to Cape Blanco (Lat. 4° S.) to 3500
                           miles—its superficial area to 7,400,000 square miles. A chain of mountains which
                           extend along the western coast, and stretch from north to south, or from Cape Pilares

                           Island of Trinidad. This mountain-chain, which is famed for its lofty summits,
                           covered with eternal snow and for its volcanic character, with many volcanoes still
                           in activity, is known by the name of the <span class="place-name" data-id="mountain.andes">Andes</span> (Cordillera de los Andes). Separated from the same are three

                           valleys.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The climate of this vast continent is colder than other regions under a similar
                           latitude. Many of the summits of its mountains are covered with perpetual snow and
                           even under the line, the heat is not found so extreme, as one would suppose; arising
                           very probably from the narrowness of the country and the elevation of the land. In
                           some of the countries on the banks of the Amazon and the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.negro">Rio Negro</span> it rains during ten months of the year
                           and there are other places on the shore of that continent where none falls for
                           several years. But generally speaking two seasons divide the year, the dry and the
                           rainy.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>No one can imagine the clearness of the atmosphere between the 4th and 10th degree
                           of
                           northern Latitude from the month of January to that of December; the sky is then
                           constantly cloudless, the <span class="foreign-word" lang="es">llanos</span>, these immense
                           plains which in the rainy season display a beautiful verdure, are scorched, and
                           assume the aspect of a desert; the earth cracks and whirlwinds raise large clouds
                           of
                           dust; the alligators and the large serpents remain buried in the dried mud, till they
                           are awakened from their lethargy by the first showers, which set in at the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span> about the end of April. The heat
                           increases progressively, the azure colour of the sky disappears and a grey tint is
                           spread over it; dense vapours cover the atmosphere, which is convulsed by frequent
                           thunderstorms; the rain falls in torrents, and the rivers rising above their banks,
                           inundate the surrounding plains. Thus the woody marshes of Guiana are rendered
                           insalubrious and become the abode of swarms of insects, which are the unceasing
                           torment of men and beasts.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>In these climates nature is marked by the most stupendous features and its scenery
                           abounds in the sublime and beautiful; thus are its productions as peculiar as its
                           features and the wonders which it exhibits are but sparingly known in European
                           countries. Since <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> and <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.bonpland">Bonpland</span>'s return, we have alone become
                           acquainted with 87 species of palm trees, these characteristic and distinguishing
                           signs of tropical vegetation, the pride of warmer climates, which alone give grandeur
                           to a landscape by their lofty forms and majestic appearance. The banks of the
                           <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span> and Amazon are clothed with
                           forests of the greatest extent, characterised by a variety, and a magnificence to
                           which the graphic and discerning pen of a <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> could only do justice. Enormous plains extend their verdant
                           surfaces beyond the visible horizon and the most juicy fruits, and aromatic trees,
                           which diffuse a delightful odour, arrive to a perfection which no other region can
                           boast of. The cultivated ground yields the sugar cane, the coffee-tree, the cocoa,
                           the latter of which grows wild in some parts, as well as cinnamon, vanilla, the
                           nutmeg, pepper, the camphor tree, the delicious <span class="flora-name">Ananas</span>,
                           oranges and a variety of other fruits; many medicinal plants and various sorts of
                           woods, used for dyes and carpentry. The cow-tree is peculiar to <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South America</span>, being famed for the
                           abundance of glutinous and nutritious milk which its trunk yields, when incisions
                           are
                           made in the same, and European grain is likewise cultivated upon fields, which rise
                           from 5 to 9,000 feet above the level of the sea, which gives to <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South America</span> the advantages of the
                           torrid and the temperate zone.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>In Guiana the air is filled with numerous butterflies of the most splendid colours
                           and in the forests, myriads of shining flies astonish the traveller by night. But
                           as
                           if to counterbalance these shining peculiarities of the torrid zone, insects exist,
                           which occasion the greatest annoyance to its inhabitants. Thus are the different
                           tribes of 
                           <div>tipulae</div> of which the 
                           <div>mosquito</div> forms a species, and of the tribes of reptiles, the largest and
                           most venomous snakes, e.g., the <i class="zoological-name">boa constrictor</i>, the
                           <i class="zoological-name">rattle snake</i> and several other kinds, dangerous for
                           their being armed with deadly poison. The rivers abound in fishes and likewise in
                           alligators. A variety of birds, distinguished by the richness of their plumage or
                           their size, from the <i class="zoological-name">colibri</i> to the <i class="zoological-name">condor</i>, people the trees of the forests and the plains.
                           Apes of the most fantastic appearance are distributed through the woods—the peculiar
                           tribe of quadrupeds, defective with respect to teeth, appear to be confined to the
                           new world, thus are the <i class="zoological-name">sloth</i>, the <i class="zoological-name">ant-eater</i>, the <i class="zoological-name">armadillo</i>.
                           The forests are neither void of beasts of prey, and the <i class="zoological-name">jaguar</i> and <i class="zoological-name">puma</i> or <i class="zoological-name">cougar</i> (<i class="zoological-name">Felis onca</i> and <i class="zoological-name">Felis concolor &amp; discolor</i>), commit depredations and
                           the first attacks even men. Extensive plains are covered with herds of horses, mules
                           and oxen, the offspring of European races.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>These animals were introduced by the Spaniards in 1548 and have since multiplied to
                           that extent, that <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> supposes
                           millions to rove wild over the <span class="foreign-word" lang="es">llanos</span> during the
                           period of his travels, the export from Venezuela to the West India Islands amounted
                           annually to 30,000 mules, 147,000 cow-hides, and 140,000 
                           <div>Arobes</div> of 
                           <div>Tassajó</div> or slightly salted and
                           dried meat.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Nor is the mineral kingdom poor in productions; <span class="place-name" data-id="place.brazil">Brazil</span> produces diamonds, gold; and other parts of <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South America</span> abound in iron, tin, lead,
                           quicksilver—like precious ores are found in <span class="place-name" data-id="place.chile">Chile</span> and the silver-mines of Potosi are famed for their rich
                           returns.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>This vast empire was formerly almost in the sole possession of two European nations,
                           the Spaniards and Portuguese, but with the exception of Guiana, it is at present
                           entirely independent of Europe. It is divided into the empire of <span class="place-name" data-id="place.brazil">Brazil</span>, the republics of <span class="place-name" data-id="place.colombia">Colombia</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="place.venezuela">Venezuela</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="place.peru">Peru</span>,
                           <span class="place-name" data-id="place.ecuador">Ecuador</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="place.bolivia">Bolivia</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="place.chile">Chile</span>, <span class="place-name" data-id="place.buenos_aires">Buenos
                              Ayres</span> or the united Provinces of la Plata, the Banda Oriental,
                           <span class="place-name" data-id="place.paraguay">Paraguay</span> and the <span class="place-name" data-id="place.terra_del_fuego">Terra del Fuego</span>, the latter of which is
                           in the possession of the natives; the whole population having been estimated at
                           between 13 and 14 million, there would not be more than 2 persons on each square mile
                           of its superficial area. The inhabitants are composed of whites, Indians and negroes
                           and their mixed races. The whites are mostly creoles, the number of Europeans is but
                           small. The Indians or native tribes are in some parts still independent, and have
                           been in others subdued and mostly converted to the Catholic religion. The negroes
                           are
                           Africans or descendants of Africans.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>When I spoke of the groups of mountains, which subdivide the southern part of the
                           new
                           Continent, I mentioned likewise the <span class="place-name" data-id="mountain.sierra_parime">Sierra
                              Parime</span>, and after having given a rapid sketch of <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South America</span> in general, I shall now
                           dwell more particularly on the country encompassed by this chain and its branches,
                           as
                           it is to form that region, to the investigation of which, I intend to dedicate the
                           first years of my planned expedition. But I shall prefer to point out firstly the
                           main object of my journey, and to propose a route which shall conduct me to the
                           attainment of the same and like the traveller, whose steps lead him gradually to new
                           prospects and to the beauties of a favoured climate, describe on the way the
                           prominent features, which according to those, who visited or described these regions
                           before, astonish the wanderer or attract his contemplative and reflecting mind to
                           the
                           mighty handiwork of the creative power.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The object of this planned journey is:</p>
                        
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>1. To examine the features of the country, its mountains, the bed and banks of
                              rivers, whether navigable, whether tributary streams or the confluence of several,
                              the river’s descent, the productions of the soil through which it drains, the
                              country’s climate, its animal and vegetable kingdom.</li>
                           
                           <li>2. The character of the inhabitants—whether civilization has been attempted or
                              is in progress and by what nation, or what prospects there are for attempting it;
                              furthermore to make most minute observations, whether trade might be carried on
                              with them, in what the barter probably would consist and in what way the same
                              might be carried on to the greatest advantage for Europeans.</li>
                           
                           <li>3. To determine geographically the country which I investigate, by ascertaining
                              astronomically the most prominent features and to collect such materials as will
                              assist in forming accurate delineations of the same and to neglect no opportunity
                              to note such phenomena as might contribute to a description of its physical
                              geography.</li>
                           
                           <li>4. To form not only collections of plants, but likewise of minerals, insects,
                              etc.</li>
                           </ul>
                        
                        
                        <p>Conformable to an expressed wish of the Royal Geographical Society of London, I would
                           commence my researches in <span class="place-name" data-id="place.demerara">Demerara</span>,
                           and laying the investigation of the Imataka mountains (between the 7th and 8th degree
                           of northern latitude) for the present aside, I place the reader at once on the river
                           <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span>, which is nine miles
                           west from the Demerary River, and its mouth above twenty miles wide. At the mouth
                           of
                           the same are three islands, which are valuable for the high state of their
                           cultivation; the easternmost is Leguan, that in the centre Wakenaam and the next
                           Tiger Island, which form four entrances into the river. Southward of these are a
                           succession of other islands, which extend five and twenty to thirty miles beyond the
                           first. About fifteen miles from the mouth is Fort-Island, which was formerly
                           fortified, but is now in decay. The tides of the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span> are pretty regular and extend nearly a hundred miles up.
                           The confluence of the rivers Coyoni or Cuyuni and Mazarony, with the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span> takes place about forty miles above
                           the river’s mouth (Lat 6° 24’ north). The Rinocote and the Usupania mountains give
                           an
                           opening to the Mazarony by a break in the hills which form in the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span> the 39 falls which are accounted
                           from Arinda (a former military post Lat. 5°30’ N.) to the mouth of the Rupunuri. Long
                           before we approach the confluence of these three rivers—(where there was formerly
                           opposite the stream Tupuro a Dutch military post, Kyk-over-al) all traces of
                           cultivation have disappeared, and the eye observes only an impenetrable forest, which
                           stretches from both sides of the river deep in the interior. The next river of
                           consequence which flows into the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span>, is the Sibarona, the sources of which are found on the
                           northern side of the Pacarayna mountains, at the same time the Tavaricuri, a
                           tributary stream of the Rupunuri originates on the southern side of the same group
                           of
                           mountains—thus drains the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span>
                           both declivities.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The Rupunuri falls at 4° 10' Lat. into the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span>; between one of its tributary streams, which I named
                           already, the Tavaricuri and the stream Pirara, a tributary of the Mahu, exists a land
                           carriage (<span class="term">Portage</span>)—a small tongue of land, which divides the basin of
                           two rivers and over which the boats are either carried upon the shoulders of the crew
                           or dragged upon rollers—I shall henceforth call them "Portage"—a second one is more
                           southerly between the Rupunuri and the Sarauri, which flows into the Tacutu. The
                           first European who crossed the latter portage was <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.hortsmann">Nicolas Hortsmann</span>, a native from Hildesheim in Germany and who had
                           settled as surgeon in Guiana. Attracted by the reports of great riches which might
                           be
                           discovered in the interior, he manned in 1739 a canoe (<span class="term">coreal</span>) with
                           Indians and ascended the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.essequibo">Essequebo</span>
                           and followed its course by dragging the canoe along its rapids and causing it to be
                           carried across the narrow neck of land, until he reached the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.branco">Rio Branco</span>, which he descended to the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.negro">Rio Negro</span> and arrived in 1740 in Pará. Here he
                           met the French academician M. Condamine, to whom he communicated a map of his route
                           and a sketch of his journal. This was very likely the journal, which afterwards was
                           found amongst the papers of the celebrated Geographer <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.danville">d’Anville</span> and which <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> found an opportunity to peruse.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>At a later period (1793) Don Fr. José Rodriguez Barate (then stationed as ensign in
                           Pará) crossed this portage twice on his way to Surinam, where he went on the object
                           of business for his government; and but lately there arrived (February 1811) several
                           Dutch colonists by the same isthmus at the Portuguese fort San Joaquin in order to
                           receive permission from its commander to descend the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.branco">Rio Branco</span>.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Having crossed the more northern portage between the Tavaricuri and the cano Pirara,
                           we find ourselves at once upon the classical ground of El Dorado de la Parime and
                           in
                           the midst of the high mountains, which since the 16th century encircled the Laguna
                           de
                           Parime or the lake of Rupunuwini, that figured until lately upon the maps of
                           <span class="place-name" data-id="place.south_america">South America</span>; regions which
                           to this period are but imperfectly known and which are inhabited by independent
                           tribes of Indians. In the journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London II Vol.
                           p. 227 is an able treatise on the Indians which inhabit Demerara, to which I shall
                           refer the readers for information.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>It was my intention to speak before this of the different groups of mountains, which
                           we have passed in our route, but as particular interest is attached to the spot which
                           we have reached and which obliges us to make a halt and to recall bygone days; I
                           shall repair this omission and give now a connected view of the most distinguished
                           branches of the whole system which <span class="person-name" data-id="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</span> has called the System of Parime.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>I.</strong> The base of the mountain-barrier, which separates the plains
                           of the lower <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span> from those of the
                           <span class="place-name" data-id="river.negro">Rio Negro</span>, extends from the 3rd to the
                           8th parallel of N. Lat and between the 66th and 68th Meridian (counted west from
                           Greenwich). Its general direction is westward which course is likewise kept by its
                           lateral branches; from the mouth of the Apure to the delta of the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span>, the distance of the ridge from the
                           banks of the river is generally 10 to 14 miles; some detached groups approach however
                           its very banks and form the rapids of Tomo, the Boca del Infierno and the narrow
                           passage at St. Thomas, from which the town has been named Angostura.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>1.</strong> The most northern branch of this group is the one which
                           extends from the Rio Arui (7° 50’) to Angostura and from thence towards the Rio
                           Carony and the sources of the Imataca (62° merid).</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>2.</strong> Another group rises from the basin of the Rio Caura, where
                           they form the rapids of Mura; they stretch to the springs of the Rio Cuchivero and
                           encompass by a detached branch Encaramada.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>3.</strong> The next are the Chaviripe mountains (7° 10’), which send off
                           a branch to the southward (6° 20’ to 6° 40’) and being connected with the Corozal
                           and
                           Amoco mountains, this group joins lastly the high ridge of the Matacuna
                           mountains.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>4.</strong> The Baraguan forms the narrow passage of the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span> (7° 5’) which has received its name
                           from this mountain-chain (Angostura del Baraguan). It takes afterwards its direction
                           towards the mountains which separate the sources of the Rio Caure from those of the
                           Ventuari.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>5.</strong> At latitude 6° 25’ rise the Carichana mountains, of wild
                           appearance but interspersed with rich pasture grounds.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>6.</strong> The western bank of the <span class="place-name" data-id="river.orinoco">Orinoco</span>, which has been mostly level, distinguishes itself by the
                           Peak of Uniana which rises from a plain to the height of more than 3000 feet (6°
                           42’); the dyke which forms the Cataract of Apures, diverges from the Peak of Uniana
                           and rises on the eastern shore to a group, which approaches the Cerro Cunuri (5° 35’
                           to 5° 40’).</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><span class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><sup>*</sup>All the parallels are northern and the
                              Meridians west from Greenwich, where the contrary is not observed.</span></p>
