            <p>Amongst the expeditions, which since <persName ref="pers.columbus"
                  >Columbus</persName>'s times have been undertaken to the new continent, shine
               conspicuously <persName ref="pers.humboldt">von Humboldt</persName>’s Travels to
               the equinoctial regions, the happy result of which has so vastly enriched physical
               science, that those publications which issued from <persName ref="pers.humboldt"
                  >Humboldt</persName> and <persName ref="pers.bonpland">Bonpland</persName> (his
               courageous and enlightened friend and fellow traveller) as the fruits of their
               combined investigations during their perilous journey, have been called by a
               competent judge a work <q>“of gigantic extent and richness to which the modern
                  literature of Europe can hardly offer a parallel.”</q> It does not belong to my
               present subject to enumerate the addition which sciences in general received from
               this expedition, their value has been acknowledged long before this by a grateful
               public and placed the name of <persName ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName>
               amongst those, which even time will not obliterate.</p>

            <p>More than thirty years have elapsed since <persName ref="pers.humboldt"
                  >Humboldt</persName> returned to Europe and his expressed wish, that he soon might
               find a successor in a similar undertaking, may have been partly realized, but still
               not to the full extent as the philosopher wished. Several journeys have been
               undertaken to <placeName ref="place.colombia">Colombia</placeName> and <placeName
                  ref="place.brazil">Brazil</placeName>, but neither has had a pure scientific
               view for its object, and though Geography and Statistics in general may have reaped
               some additions by these casual journeys, <persName ref="pers.humboldt"
                  >Humboldt</persName>’s expressed hopes remain unrealized—no geographical
               situations have been determined, no botanist has herbalized on the banks of the
                  <placeName ref="river.meta">Meta</placeName>, <placeName ref="river.vichada"
                  >Vichada</placeName>, <placeName ref="river.zama">Zama</placeName>, <placeName
                  ref="river.branco">Branco</placeName>, and <placeName ref="river.negro"

         <div type="section">
            <p>The height of fame which <persName ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName> has
               reached by his journey and his subsequent publications, which resulted from the same,
               might perhaps prevent the planning of a similar expedition, where the predecessor was
               so richly endowed with a genius, which in his sphere stands single at the present
               age, but circumstances are the rulers of human undertakings and though <persName
                  ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName> determined the nature of the <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName>’s communication with the <placeName
                  ref="river.negro">Rio Negro</placeName>, the more interesting object of their
               journey, the mighty river’s sources, remained a geographical problem. The hostile
               Indians prevented the travellers from penetrating much further than <placeName
                  ref="place.esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName>. The circumstances may have
               changed, and what <persName ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName> found at that
               time impossible, may be accomplished by perseverance. But this is not the only
               stirring impulse to action, the illustrious traveller expresses frequently the wish,
               that several geographical positions which unfavourable weather prevented him to
               ascertain, might be hereafter astronomically determined. He entertained likewise the
               hope, that a botanist might herbalize on the banks of the rivers, <placeName
                  ref="river.meta">Meta</placeName>, <placeName ref="river.vichada"
                  >Vichada</placeName>, <placeName ref="river.zama">Zama</placeName>, <placeName
                  ref="river.branco">Branco</placeName>, <placeName ref="river.negro"
                  >Negro</placeName>, &amp;c., &amp;c., and says especially, that a traveller, who
               was favoured with the hospitality of the missionaries could spend a year on the banks
               of the rivers <placeName ref="river.atabapo">Atabapo</placeName>, <placeName
                  ref="river.tuamini">Tuamini</placeName> and <placeName ref="river.negro"
                  >Negro</placeName>, and a second year on the mountains of <placeName
                  ref="place.esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName> and the upper <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> might easily triplicate the species
               described by <persName ref="pers.aublet">Aublet</persName> and <persName
                  ref="pers.richard">Richard</persName>. He was further obliged to restrict his
               investigations only to the skirts of the <placeName ref="mountain.sierra_parime"
                  >Sierra Parime</placeName>, and the interesting part, encompassed by the branches
               of this mountain-chain, remained unexplored. Thus a rich field has been left open for
               further investigation, the happy result of which may amply reward the dangers and
               perils connected with a similar enterprise, and though but few in the lapse of
               centuries could dare to enter the lists with a <persName ref="pers.humboldt"
                  >Humboldt</persName> whose rare talent possessed a variety of knowledge to avail
               himself of every advantage, where opportunity offered him to exercise the same, still
               I do not shrink from planning a new expedition to <placeName
                  ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName>. Blessed with a strong
               constitution and acclimatized during a sojourn of four years in the <placeName
                  ref="place.west_indies">West Indies</placeName>, the most time of which was
               spent in botanical excursions and surveying expeditions, accustomed therefore to
               bodily exercises and possessed of some knowledge of physics, I hope a European public
               will not consider it presumptuous and chimerical at my having resolved to undertake a
               scientific journey to <placeName ref="place.south_america">South
                  America</placeName>, provided I am encouraged and assisted; and in this respect I
               have placed my chief anchor of hope on England, which has always shown herself ready
               to protect schemes of utility and to give her powerful assistance to the execution of
               plans, which have been connected with the advancement of science and the furtherance
               of useful knowledge.</p>

            <p>In order to become more acquainted with the real object of my planned expedition, I
               attract the reader’s attention to the following observations which with the
               assistance of the annexed Maps will partly point out my proposed route. The Map as
               well as the observations have been mostly compiled from <persName
                  ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName>’s travels to the equinoctial Regions,
                  <persName ref="pers.bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>’s Voyage to Demerary,
               Colombia &amp; Vol. London. 1822, and for the further constructions of the map, I
               have been assisted by "<persName ref="pers.tanner">Tanner</persName>’s map of
                  <placeName ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName> on the basis of
                  <persName ref="pers.cary">John Cary</persName>’s and <persName
                  ref="pers.la_cruz">La Cruz</persName>’s maps of the whole continent. <persName
                  ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName>’s geographical Atlas and his map of the
                  <placeName ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> were unfortunately not in my
               reach.</p>

         <div type="section">
            <p><placeName ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName>, or the southern
               half of the new world, forms a triangle and extends from Latitude 12° N. to 52° 30’
               S. and from 35° to 80° W. Longitude. It is connected with the northern part of the
               new continent by the Isthmus of Darien and its greatest extent from the Gulf of
               Maracaybo to the Straits of Magellan has been computed to consist of 4600 miles—its
               greatest breadth from Cape St. Roque (Lat. 5° S.) to Cape Blanco (Lat. 4° S.) to 3500
               miles—its superficial area to 7,400,000 square miles. A chain of mountains which
               extend along the western coast, and stretch from north to south, or from Cape Pilares
               at the western part of the Strait of Magellan to the Cape of Paria, opposite the
               Island of Trinidad. This mountain-chain, which is famed for its lofty summits,
               covered with eternal snow and for its volcanic character, with many volcanoes still
               in activity, is known by the name of the <placeName ref="mountain.andes"
                  >Andes</placeName> (Cordillera de los Andes). Separated from the same are three
               groups of mountains, which have no connection with the <placeName
                  ref="mountain.andes">Andes</placeName>, one of which is northerly situated from
               the same and two to the east; namely the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the <placeName
                  ref="mountain.sierra_parime">Sierra de la Parime</placeName>, between the 4th
               and 8th parallel of northern Latitude, and the mountains of Brazil (Chiquitos),
               between the 15th and 28th parallel of southern Latitude.</p>

            <p>This singular division of mountains forms three great basins, which contain
               four-fifths of the whole surface of <placeName ref="place.south_america">South
                  America</placeName>, between the mountains of Venezuela and the group of Parime
               extend the plains of Apure and the lower <placeName ref="river.orinoco"
                  >Orinoco</placeName>; between the Sierra of Parime and those of Brazil are the
               plains of the rivers Amazon, <placeName ref="river.negro">Negro</placeName> and
               Madeira, and between the mountains of Brazil or the Chiquitos and the southern end of
               the continent are the plains of the Rio Plata. Their division distinguishes the
               valleys of the three great rivers, which drain the whole continent, the <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName>, the Amazon, and the Plata.</p>

            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="es">llanos</foreign> and plateaus or elevated plains, are
               striking features in the Geography of <placeName ref="place.south_america">South
                  America</placeName>. The <foreign xml:lang="es">llanos</foreign>, the first of
               which extends (i.e., from the mountains of Caraccas to the forests of Guiana and the
               delta of the <placeName ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName>) over a space of
               250,000 sq. miles and form three divisions connected by narrow openings, two of
               which, namely the <foreign xml:lang="es">llanos</foreign> of the lower <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> and those of the Rio Plata or Buenos
               Ayres, are overgrown with grasses; the one which is situated between them, or the
                  <foreign xml:lang="es">llanos</foreign> of the river Amazon is covered with
               impenetrable wood. The plateaus or table land of the <placeName
                  ref="mountain.andes">Andes</placeName> are inferior in extent, scarcely 100
               miles in circuit, but they are from 8,000 to 9,000 feet elevated above the sea—the
               plains of Quito are 12,000 feet above the level of the sea—and are separated by deep
               valleys.</p>

            <p>The climate of this vast continent is colder than other regions under a similar
               latitude. Many of the summits of its mountains are covered with perpetual snow and
               even under the line, the heat is not found so extreme, as one would suppose; arising
               very probably from the narrowness of the country and the elevation of the land. In
               some of the countries on the banks of the Amazon and the <placeName
                  ref="river.negro">Rio Negro</placeName> it rains during ten months of the year
               and there are other places on the shore of that continent where none falls for
               several years. But generally speaking two seasons divide the year, the dry and the
               rainy.</p>

            <p>No one can imagine the clearness of the atmosphere between the 4th and 10th degree of
               northern Latitude from the month of January to that of December; the sky is then
               constantly cloudless, the <foreign xml:lang="es">llanos</foreign>, these immense
               plains which in the rainy season display a beautiful verdure, are scorched, and
               assume the aspect of a desert; the earth cracks and whirlwinds raise large clouds of
               dust; the alligators and the large serpents remain buried in the dried mud, till they
               are awakened from their lethargy by the first showers, which set in at the <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> about the end of April. The heat
               increases progressively, the azure colour of the sky disappears and a grey tint is
               spread over it; dense vapours cover the atmosphere, which is convulsed by frequent
               thunderstorms; the rain falls in torrents, and the rivers rising above their banks,
               inundate the surrounding plains. Thus the woody marshes of Guiana are rendered
               insalubrious and become the abode of swarms of insects, which are the unceasing
               torment of men and beasts.</p>


            <p>In these climates nature is marked by the most stupendous features and its scenery
               abounds in the sublime and beautiful; thus are its productions as peculiar as its
               features and the wonders which it exhibits are but sparingly known in European
               countries. Since <persName ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName> and <persName
                  ref="pers.bonpland">Bonpland</persName>'s return, we have alone become
               acquainted with 87 species of palm trees, these characteristic and distinguishing
               signs of tropical vegetation, the pride of warmer climates, which alone give grandeur
               to a landscape by their lofty forms and majestic appearance. The banks of the
                  <placeName ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> and Amazon are clothed with
               forests of the greatest extent, characterised by a variety, and a magnificence to
               which the graphic and discerning pen of a <persName ref="pers.humboldt"
                  >Humboldt</persName> could only do justice. Enormous plains extend their verdant
               surfaces beyond the visible horizon and the most juicy fruits, and aromatic trees,
               which diffuse a delightful odour, arrive to a perfection which no other region can
               boast of. The cultivated ground yields the sugar cane, the coffee-tree, the cocoa,
               the latter of which grows wild in some parts, as well as cinnamon, vanilla, the
               nutmeg, pepper, the camphor tree, the delicious <name type="flora">Ananas</name>,
               oranges and a variety of other fruits; many medicinal plants and various sorts of
               woods, used for dyes and carpentry. The cow-tree is peculiar to <placeName
                  ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName>, being famed for the
               abundance of glutinous and nutritious milk which its trunk yields, when incisions are
               made in the same, and European grain is likewise cultivated upon fields, which rise
               from 5 to 9,000 feet above the level of the sea, which gives to <placeName
                  ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName> the advantages of the
               torrid and the temperate zone.</p>

            <p>In Guiana the air is filled with numerous butterflies of the most splendid colours
               and in the forests, myriads of shining flies astonish the traveller by night. But as
               if to counterbalance these shining peculiarities of the torrid zone, insects exist,
               which occasion the greatest annoyance to its inhabitants. Thus are the different
               tribes of <name type="insect">tipulae</name> of which the <name type="insect"
                  >mosquito</name> forms a species, and of the tribes of reptiles, the largest and
               most venomous snakes, e.g., the <name type="zoological">boa constrictor</name>, the
                  <name type="zoological">rattle snake</name> and several other kinds, dangerous for
               their being armed with deadly poison. The rivers abound in fishes and likewise in
               alligators. A variety of birds, distinguished by the richness of their plumage or
               their size, from the <name type="zoological">colibri</name> to the <name
                  type="zoological">condor</name>, people the trees of the forests and the plains.
               Apes of the most fantastic appearance are distributed through the woods—the peculiar
               tribe of quadrupeds, defective with respect to teeth, appear to be confined to the
               new world, thus are the <name type="zoological">sloth</name>, the <name
                  type="zoological">ant-eater</name>, the <name type="zoological">armadillo</name>.
               The forests are neither void of beasts of prey, and the <name type="zoological"
                  >jaguar</name> and <name type="zoological">puma</name> or <name type="zoological"
                  >cougar</name> (<name type="zoological">Felis onca</name> and <name
                  type="zoological">Felis concolor &amp; discolor</name>), commit depredations and
               the first attacks even men. Extensive plains are covered with herds of horses, mules
               and oxen, the offspring of European races.</p>

            <p>These animals were introduced by the Spaniards in 1548 and have since multiplied to
               that extent, that <persName ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName> supposes
               millions to rove wild over the <foreign xml:lang="es">llanos</foreign> during the
               period of his travels, the export from Venezuela to the West India Islands amounted
               annually to 30,000 mules, 147,000 cow-hides, and 140,000 <measure type="weight"
                  >Arobes</measure> of <name type="product">Tassajó</name> or slightly salted and
               dried meat.</p>

            <p>Nor is the mineral kingdom poor in productions; <placeName ref="place.brazil"
                  >Brazil</placeName> produces diamonds, gold; and other parts of <placeName
                  ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName> abound in iron, tin, lead,
               quicksilver—like precious ores are found in <placeName ref="place.chile"
                  >Chile</placeName> and the silver-mines of Potosi are famed for their rich
               returns.</p>

            <p>This vast empire was formerly almost in the sole possession of two European nations,
               the Spaniards and Portuguese, but with the exception of Guiana, it is at present
               entirely independent of Europe. It is divided into the empire of <placeName
                  ref="place.brazil">Brazil</placeName>, the republics of <placeName
                  ref="place.colombia">Colombia</placeName>, <placeName ref="place.venezuela"
                  >Venezuela</placeName>, <placeName ref="place.peru">Peru</placeName>,
                  <placeName ref="place.ecuador">Ecuador</placeName>, <placeName
                  ref="place.bolivia">Bolivia</placeName>, <placeName ref="place.chile"
                  >Chile</placeName>, <placeName ref="place.buenos_aires">Buenos
                  Ayres</placeName> or the united Provinces of la Plata, the Banda Oriental,
                  <placeName ref="place.paraguay">Paraguay</placeName> and the <placeName
                  ref="place.terra_del_fuego">Terra del Fuego</placeName>, the latter of which is
               in the possession of the natives; the whole population having been estimated at
               between 13 and 14 million, there would not be more than 2 persons on each square mile
               of its superficial area. The inhabitants are composed of whites, Indians and negroes
               and their mixed races. The whites are mostly creoles, the number of Europeans is but
               small. The Indians or native tribes are in some parts still independent, and have
               been in others subdued and mostly converted to the Catholic religion. The negroes are
               Africans or descendants of Africans.</p>

            <p>When I spoke of the groups of mountains, which subdivide the southern part of the new
               Continent, I mentioned likewise the <placeName ref="mountain.sierra_parime">Sierra
                  Parime</placeName>, and after having given a rapid sketch of <placeName
                  ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName> in general, I shall now
               dwell more particularly on the country encompassed by this chain and its branches, as
               it is to form that region, to the investigation of which, I intend to dedicate the
               first years of my planned expedition. But I shall prefer to point out firstly the
               main object of my journey, and to propose a route which shall conduct me to the
               attainment of the same and like the traveller, whose steps lead him gradually to new
               prospects and to the beauties of a favoured climate, describe on the way the
               prominent features, which according to those, who visited or described these regions
               before, astonish the wanderer or attract his contemplative and reflecting mind to the
               mighty handiwork of the creative power.</p>

            <p>The object of this planned journey is:</p>

            <list>
               <item>1. To examine the features of the country, its mountains, the bed and banks of
                  rivers, whether navigable, whether tributary streams or the confluence of several,
                  the river’s descent, the productions of the soil through which it drains, the
                  country’s climate, its animal and vegetable kingdom.</item>
               <item>2. The character of the inhabitants—whether civilization has been attempted or
                  is in progress and by what nation, or what prospects there are for attempting it;
                  furthermore to make most minute observations, whether trade might be carried on
                  with them, in what the barter probably would consist and in what way the same
                  might be carried on to the greatest advantage for Europeans.</item>
               <item>3. To determine geographically the country which I investigate, by ascertaining
                  astronomically the most prominent features and to collect such materials as will
                  assist in forming accurate delineations of the same and to neglect no opportunity
                  to note such phenomena as might contribute to a description of its physical
                  geography.</item>
               <item>4. To form not only collections of plants, but likewise of minerals, insects,
                  etc.</item>
            </list>

            <p>Conformable to an expressed wish of the Royal Geographical Society of London, I would
               commence my researches in <placeName ref="place.demerara">Demerara</placeName>,
               and laying the investigation of the Imataka mountains (between the 7th and 8th degree
               of northern latitude) for the present aside, I place the reader at once on the river
                  <placeName ref="river.essequibo">Essequebo</placeName>, which is nine miles
               west from the Demerary River, and its mouth above twenty miles wide. At the mouth of
               the same are three islands, which are valuable for the high state of their
               cultivation; the easternmost is Leguan, that in the centre Wakenaam and the next
               Tiger Island, which form four entrances into the river. Southward of these are a
               succession of other islands, which extend five and twenty to thirty miles beyond the
               first. About fifteen miles from the mouth is Fort-Island, which was formerly
               fortified, but is now in decay. The tides of the <placeName ref="river.essequibo"
                  >Essequebo</placeName> are pretty regular and extend nearly a hundred miles up.
               The confluence of the rivers Coyoni or Cuyuni and Mazarony, with the <placeName
                  ref="river.essequibo">Essequebo</placeName> takes place about forty miles above
               the river’s mouth (Lat 6° 24’ north). The Rinocote and the Usupania mountains give an
               opening to the Mazarony by a break in the hills which form in the <placeName
                  ref="river.essequibo">Essequebo</placeName> the 39 falls which are accounted
               from Arinda (a former military post Lat. 5°30’ N.) to the mouth of the Rupunuri. Long
               before we approach the confluence of these three rivers—(where there was formerly
               opposite the stream Tupuro a Dutch military post, Kyk-over-al) all traces of
               cultivation have disappeared, and the eye observes only an impenetrable forest, which
               stretches from both sides of the river deep in the interior. The next river of
               consequence which flows into the <placeName ref="river.essequibo"
                  >Essequebo</placeName>, is the Sibarona, the sources of which are found on the
               northern side of the Pacarayna mountains, at the same time the Tavaricuri, a
               tributary stream of the Rupunuri originates on the southern side of the same group of
               mountains—thus drains the <placeName ref="river.essequibo">Essequebo</placeName>
               both declivities.</p>

            <p>The Rupunuri falls at 4° 10' Lat. into the <placeName ref="river.essequibo"
                  >Essequebo</placeName>; between one of its tributary streams, which I named
               already, the Tavaricuri and the stream Pirara, a tributary of the Mahu, exists a land
               carriage (<term>Portage</term>)—a small tongue of land, which divides the basin of
               two rivers and over which the boats are either carried upon the shoulders of the crew
               or dragged upon rollers—I shall henceforth call them "Portage"—a second one is more
               southerly between the Rupunuri and the Sarauri, which flows into the Tacutu. The
               first European who crossed the latter portage was <persName ref="pers.hortsmann"
                  >Nicolas Hortsmann</persName>, a native from Hildesheim in Germany and who had
               settled as surgeon in Guiana. Attracted by the reports of great riches which might be
               discovered in the interior, he manned in 1739 a canoe (<term>coreal</term>) with
               Indians and ascended the <placeName ref="river.essequibo">Essequebo</placeName>
               and followed its course by dragging the canoe along its rapids and causing it to be
               carried across the narrow neck of land, until he reached the <placeName
                  ref="river.branco">Rio Branco</placeName>, which he descended to the <placeName
                  ref="river.negro">Rio Negro</placeName> and arrived in 1740 in Pará. Here he
               met the French academician M. Condamine, to whom he communicated a map of his route
               and a sketch of his journal. This was very likely the journal, which afterwards was
               found amongst the papers of the celebrated Geographer <persName
                  ref="pers.danville">d’Anville</persName> and which <persName
                  ref="pers.humboldt">Humboldt</persName> found an opportunity to peruse.</p>

            <p>At a later period (1793) Don Fr. José Rodriguez Barate (then stationed as ensign in
               Pará) crossed this portage twice on his way to Surinam, where he went on the object
               of business for his government; and but lately there arrived (February 1811) several
               Dutch colonists by the same isthmus at the Portuguese fort San Joaquin in order to
               receive permission from its commander to descend the <placeName ref="river.branco"
                  >Rio Branco</placeName>.</p>

            <p>Having crossed the more northern portage between the Tavaricuri and the cano Pirara,
               we find ourselves at once upon the classical ground of El Dorado de la Parime and in
               the midst of the high mountains, which since the 16th century encircled the Laguna de
               Parime or the lake of Rupunuwini, that figured until lately upon the maps of
                  <placeName ref="place.south_america">South America</placeName>; regions which
               to this period are but imperfectly known and which are inhabited by independent
               tribes of Indians. In the journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London II Vol.
               p. 227 is an able treatise on the Indians which inhabit Demerara, to which I shall
               refer the readers for information.</p>

            <p>It was my intention to speak before this of the different groups of mountains, which
               we have passed in our route, but as particular interest is attached to the spot which
               we have reached and which obliges us to make a halt and to recall bygone days; I
               shall repair this omission and give now a connected view of the most distinguished
               branches of the whole system which <persName ref="pers.humboldt"
                  >Humboldt</persName> has called the System of Parime.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">I.</hi> The base of the mountain-barrier, which separates the plains
               of the lower <placeName ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> from those of the
                  <placeName ref="river.negro">Rio Negro</placeName>, extends from the 3rd to the
               8th parallel of N. Lat and between the 66th and 68th Meridian (counted west from
               Greenwich). Its general direction is westward which course is likewise kept by its
               lateral branches; from the mouth of the Apure to the delta of the <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName>, the distance of the ridge from the
               banks of the river is generally 10 to 14 miles; some detached groups approach however
               its very banks and form the rapids of Tomo, the Boca del Infierno and the narrow
               passage at St. Thomas, from which the town has been named Angostura.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">1.</hi> The most northern branch of this group is the one which
               extends from the Rio Arui (7° 50’) to Angostura and from thence towards the Rio
               Carony and the sources of the Imataca (62° merid).</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">2.</hi> Another group rises from the basin of the Rio Caura, where
               they form the rapids of Mura; they stretch to the springs of the Rio Cuchivero and
               encompass by a detached branch Encaramada.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">3.</hi> The next are the Chaviripe mountains (7° 10’), which send off
               a branch to the southward (6° 20’ to 6° 40’) and being connected with the Corozal and
               Amoco mountains, this group joins lastly the high ridge of the Matacuna
               mountains.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">4.</hi> The Baraguan forms the narrow passage of the <placeName
                  ref="river.orinoco">Orinoco</placeName> (7° 5’) which has received its name
               from this mountain-chain (Angostura del Baraguan). It takes afterwards its direction
               towards the mountains which separate the sources of the Rio Caure from those of the
               Ventuari.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">5.</hi> At latitude 6° 25’ rise the Carichana mountains, of wild
               appearance but interspersed with rich pasture grounds.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">6.</hi> The western bank of the <placeName ref="river.orinoco"
                  >Orinoco</placeName>, which has been mostly level, distinguishes itself by the
               Peak of Uniana which rises from a plain to the height of more than 3000 feet (6°
               42’); the dyke which forms the Cataract of Apures, diverges from the Peak of Uniana
               and rises on the eastern shore to a group, which approaches the Cerro Cunuri (5° 35’
               to 5° 40’).</p>

            <p><note type="footnote" xml:id="footnote-1">All the parallels are northern and the
                  Meridians west from Greenwich, where the contrary is not observed.</note></p>
